## Data Structures and Algorithms

Learning Data Structures (the way we are able to store and retrieve data) & Algorithms (how data is transformed into something a program can effectively use), is the foundation to software development.

There is a lot to cover in this area (typically taught in Computer Science degree modules over months) however today, we’ll be working through some introduction exercises to get started. If you are completely new to these concepts, we recommend grabbing a coffee and taking some time to read the following articles:

As we are focusing today on Data Structures & Algorithms in Python, you can spend some time on the following Python resources or go ahead set up and try the exercises in Part 1 Data Structures.
 
 
### Brushing up or completely new to Python
Python Fundamentals on pythonprogramming.net
Google's Python Class
The Python Tutorial from the Documentation
Python Tutorial on Codecademy


### Setup 
We will be using Google Colab to complete the exercises. [What is Google Colab](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/faq.html)

Feel free to work on the exercises and challenges with a partner. Paired programming in awesome. Mob programming is cool too!



## Part 1 Data Structures 
Save a copy of the Data Structures notebook so you can edit your own version of the file.
https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ASWPAYu3z4gmWIsRYYj4BX4Wjk4Q9GiZ

In this notebook, you will find a brief summary on the built in python data structures and also some other data structures. Throughout the notebook, there are exercises that you can complete.

Here are some more data structures exercises to help with your learning!
